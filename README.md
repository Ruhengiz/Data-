## The values 0 and 1 were predicted using the RandomForestClassification model 

### These values represent whether the machine has been purchased or not

## The probability of the prediction occurring was checked
## The percent probability that confusion_matrix is correctly predicted by entering accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics
